## Running Tests

### API Tests
```bash
# Run API tests
uv run python -m pytest tests/api/

# Run specific API test
uv run python tests/api/test_drag_drop_api.py
```

### Playwright Browser Tests
```bash
# Start test server first
uv run python tests/integration/test_server.py

# Run real mouse interaction tests (in another terminal)
uv run python tests/playwright/test_real_mouse_interactions.py

# Run replay mode
uv run python tests/playwright/test_real_mouse_interactions.py replay

# Run static HTML test
uv run python tests/playwright/test_static_html.py
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Start test server
uv run python tests/integration/test_server.py
```

### All Tests
```bash
# Run all pytest tests
uv run python -m pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
uv run python -m pytest tests/ --cov=apps --cov-report=html
```

## Test Types

### 1. API Tests (`tests/api/`)
- **Purpose**: Test FastAPI endpoints and Pydantic validation
- **Coverage**:
  - Route registration
  - Request/response validation
  - Error handling
  - Security (XSS protection, input limits)
  - Zone behavior validation

### 2. Playwright Tests (`tests/playwright/`)
- **Purpose**: Real browser interaction testing
- **Coverage**:
  - Drag-drop with REAL mouse events
  - Multi-select functionality
  - Zone-to-zone tag movement
  - Control interactions
  - State management verification
  - Cross-browser compatibility

### 3. Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)
- **Purpose**: Full system integration
- **Coverage**:
  - Server startup
  - Static file serving
  - Template rendering
  - Database integration (when configured)

## Test Artifacts

Generated during testing:
- `multicardz_test_recording.json` - Replayable Playwright actions
- `final_state.png` - Screenshot of final browser state
- Coverage reports in `htmlcov/`

## Requirements

### Python Dependencies
```bash
uv add --dev pytest playwright httpx
uv run playwright install chromium
```

### Manual Testing
1. Start server: `uv run python tests/integration/test_server.py`
2. Open browser: `http://localhost:8011`
3. Test drag-drop manually
