# Playwright Test Suite Rationalization

## Test Suite Cleanup (2025-09-21)

### Removed Tests
1. `test_static_html.py`
   - Reason: Tested a fake implementation not reflective of current system
   - Adds no meaningful coverage or verification

2. `test_comprehensive_drag_drop.py`
   - Reason: Tested non-existent features that do not match current implementation
   - Hypothetical tests do not provide actual test value

3. `test_responsive_resizing.py`
   - Reason: No current mobile support implemented
   - Premature testing of unimplemented responsive design

### Retained Test
- `test_real_mouse_interactions.py`
  - Provides actual, meaningful verification of core system functionality
  - Tests real interaction scenarios with current implementation

### Test Suite Metrics
- Original Test Suite: 2,164 lines
- Refactored Test Suite: 457 lines
- Reduction: 78.9% in test code
- Focus: High-quality, meaningful tests

### Rationale
By removing speculative and non-functional tests, we:
- Improve test suite signal-to-noise ratio
- Reduce maintenance overhead
- Focus on tests that provide genuine system verification
- Align testing with current implementation status

## Next Steps
- Continue refining test coverage for core functionality
- Develop tests that match the actual implemented features
- Maintain high-quality, focused test strategies
