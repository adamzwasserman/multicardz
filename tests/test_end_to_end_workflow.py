"""
End-to-End Test for MultiCardz™ Complete Workflow.

This test demonstrates the complete workflow:
1. Create database with realistic sample data
2. Load cards using two-tier architecture
3. Generate tag count tuples from database
4. Perform set operations with real database optimization
5. Verify results and performance
