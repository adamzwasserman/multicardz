# Implementation Plan Guidelines
**Document Version**: 2.0
**Date**: 2025-01-13
**Status**: MANDATORY FOR ALL IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

## Overview

This document defines comprehensive guidelines for creating detailed implementation plans that ensure test-driven development (TDD), behavior-driven development (BDD), accurate time tracking, and consistent quality across all development efforts.

## 🔴 CRITICAL: The MANDATORY 8-Step Implementation Process

This document defines the **mandatory 8-step process** that MUST be followed for every single implementation task in any implementation plan. This process ensures test-driven development (TDD), behavior-driven development (BDD), accurate time tracking, and consistent quality across all development efforts.

## The 8 Steps (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Step 1: Capture Start Time
```bash
echo "Task X.X Start: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')" >> docs/Implementation/[plan-name].md
```
- Records exact start time for metrics
- Enables accurate duration calculations
- Creates accountability

### Step 2: Create BDD Feature File
```bash
# MUST be in test folder at project root (NOT in uv packages)
touch tests/features/[feature_name].feature
```

Example feature file:
```gherkin
Feature: [Feature Name]
  As a [user/system]
  I want [functionality]
  So that [business value]

  Scenario: [Happy path scenario]
    Given [initial context]
    When [action taken]
    Then [expected outcome]

  Scenario: [Edge case scenario]
    Given [edge case context]
    When [edge action]
    Then [edge outcome]

  Scenario: [Error scenario]
    Given [error context]
    When [invalid action]
    Then [error handling]
```

**Requirements**:
- Write scenarios BEFORE any implementation code
- Cover happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
- Define clear acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format

### Step 3: Create Test Fixtures
```python
# tests/fixtures/[feature]_fixtures.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock
from typing import Set, Dict, Any

@pytest.fixture
def sample_data() -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Create test data for scenarios"""
    return {
        "workspace_id": "test-ws",
        "user_id": "test-user",
        "cards": generate_test_cards()
    }

@pytest.fixture
def mock_database():
    """Mock database connection"""
    return Mock()

@pytest.fixture
def mock_external_service():
    """Mock external API calls"""
    mock = Mock()
    mock.call.return_value = {"status": "success"}
    return mock
```

**Requirements**:
- Create all necessary mocks for external dependencies
- Set up test data generators
- Prepare database fixtures (use in-memory SQLite)
- Ensure fixtures are reusable and isolated

### Step 4: Run Red Test
```bash
pytest tests/features/[feature_name].feature -v
# EXPECTED OUTPUT: Tests fail (red state)
# This validates that tests are actually testing something
```

**Purpose**:
- Verify tests fail before implementation
- Confirms test correctness
- Ensures we're testing the right functionality
- Validates that tests will catch regressions

### Step 5: Write Implementation Code
```python
# packages/[module]/[component].py

def implement_feature(
    param1: str,
    param2: Set[str]
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Implement feature following architecture principles.

    MUST follow:
    - Function-based architecture (no classes except approved)
    - Pure set operations for filtering
    - Patent specifications compliance
    - Minimal code to make tests pass
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

**Architecture Requirements**:
- Function-based design (NO classes except Pydantic/SQLAlchemy)
- Pure set theory operations for filtering
- No JavaScript except approved WASM bridge
- HTMX for all interactivity
- Follow patent specifications

### Step 6: Run Green Test - Block Until 100% Pass
```bash
pytest tests/features/[feature_name].feature -v
# MUST achieve 100% pass rate before proceeding
# This is a hard quality gate - do not continue with failures

# Also run with coverage
pytest tests/features/[feature_name].feature --cov=[module] --cov-report=term-missing
# Target: >90% coverage for new code
```

**Requirements**:
- ALL tests must pass (100% success rate)
- Block progress until achieved
- Fix any failures before continuing
- Verify coverage targets met
- This is a non-negotiable quality gate

### Step 7: Commit and Push Using Commit Agent
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Commit with proper message format
git commit -m "[Type]: [Clear description]

- [Detailed change 1]
- [Detailed change 2]
- [Tests added/modified]
- [Architecture compliance verified]


# Push to feature branch
git push origin feature/[feature-name]
```

**Commit Message Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `test`: Adding tests
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `docs`: Documentation
- `perf`: Performance improvement

### Step 8: Capture End Time and Calculate Duration
```bash
echo "Task X.X End: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')" >> docs/Implementation/[plan-name].md

# Calculate duration (example)
START="2025-01-13 10:00:00"
END="2025-01-13 11:30:00"
# Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes
```

**Purpose**:
- Records exact completion time
- Enables duration calculation
- Provides data for future estimates
- Tracks productivity metrics

## Why This Process is Mandatory

### Quality Assurance
- **BDD-First**: Defines acceptance criteria before code
- **TDD Cycle**: Red-Green-Refactor ensures correctness
- **100% Pass Rate**: Hard quality gate prevents defects
- **Coverage Requirements**: Ensures comprehensive testing

### Accountability
- **Time Tracking**: Every task has measurable duration
- **Git History**: Shows test-driven development
- **Commit Standards**: Clear change documentation
- **Metrics**: Data for continuous improvement

### Consistency
- **Same Process**: All developers follow identical steps
- **Predictable Output**: Consistent quality across tasks
- **Architecture Compliance**: Enforced at every step
- **Review Ready**: Code always has tests

### Scalability
- **Works for Any Size**: From small fixes to large features
- **Team Coordination**: Clear handoffs between developers
- **Parallel Development**: Independent tasks can run simultaneously
- **Context Management**: Each task is self-contained

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ DO NOT:
- Write code before feature files
- Proceed with failing tests
- Skip the red state verification
- Commit without running tests
- Ignore time tracking
- Use classes for business logic
- Add custom JavaScript
- Put tests in package directories

### ✅ DO:
- Write comprehensive Gherkin scenarios first
- Block until 100% tests pass
- Verify red state before implementing
- Use commit agent for consistency
- Track time for every task
- Use function-based architecture
- Use HTMX for interactivity
- Put tests in project root tests/ folder

     As a user
     I want to authenticate with the system
     So that I can access my workspace

     Scenario: Successful login
       Given I have valid credentials
       When I submit the login form
       Then I should be authenticated
       And I should see my workspace

     Scenario: Invalid credentials
       Given I have invalid credentials
       When I submit the login form
       Then I should see an error message
       And I should not be authenticated

7. **Architecture Compliance**: Function-based design enforced
8. **Continuous Improvement**: Metrics enable process refinement

### Data-Driven Estimates:
- Use actual implementation data from similar projects
- Account for complexity multipliers
- Include BDD/TDD testing overhead (40% for comprehensive testing)
- Track accuracy for continuous improvement
- Factor in time for 8-step process execution
- Add buffer for test fixture creation and red/green cycles

## Conclusion

The 8-step process is not optional—it's the foundation of our development methodology. By following these steps exactly, we ensure:

1. **Quality**: Every feature has comprehensive tests
2. **Predictability**: Accurate time estimates from historical data
3. **Maintainability**: Clean, tested, documented code
4. **Scalability**: Consistent process across all teams
5. **Compliance**: Architecture principles enforced

This process has been proven to deliver high-quality software on predictable timelines. Deviation from this process requires explicit architectural approval and must be documented with justification.
