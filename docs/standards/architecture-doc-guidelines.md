#### 3.3 Polymorphic Architecture Mandates

**Core Principle**: "Maximum functionality with minimal code through polymorphic design"

**REQUIRED**: All rendering and data processing systems MUST use polymorphic architecture with Protocol-based interfaces. This enables:
- Single codebase supporting cards, charts, n-dimensional views, and future visualizations
- Implementation swapping without paradigm changes
- Extensibility through interface compliance rather than inheritance
- Zero-configuration addition of new rendering types

**Polymorphic Design Pattern**:
```python
from typing import Protocol, TypeVar, Generic
from abc import abstractmethod

T = TypeVar('T')
U = TypeVar('U')

class DataLoader(Protocol[T]):
    @abstractmethod
    async def load(self, context: LoadContext) -> frozenset[T]: ...

class SpatialMapper(Protocol[T, U]):
    @abstractmethod
    async def map(self, data: frozenset[T]) -> U: ...

class Renderer(Protocol[T]):
    @abstractmethod
    async def render(self, spatial_data: T) -> Any: ...
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- All data loading MUST use Protocol-based DataLoader implementations
- All spatial organization MUST use Protocol-based SpatialMapper implementations
- All output generation MUST use Protocol-based Renderer implementations
- NO direct coupling between layers - only through Protocol interfaces
- Factory functions MUST enable runtime implementation selection

#### 3.4 Code Organization Standards

**File Size Guidelines**:
- **Target Size**: 500 lines per file
- **Acceptable Range**: 300-700 lines
- **Rationale**: Balances code cohesion with cognitive complexity
- **Split Criteria**: Logical boundaries over arbitrary line counts

**File Organization Strategy**:
```
# Good: Domain-driven organization
domain/
├── core_operations.py     # ~500 lines: Primary domain logic
├── optimization.py        # ~400 lines: Performance enhancements
├── validation.py          # ~300 lines: Input/output validation
└── utilities.py           # ~250 lines: Helper functions

# Bad: Size-driven splits
domain/
├── operations_1.py        # 350 lines: Arbitrary split
├── operations_2.py        # 350 lines: No logical boundary
└── monolith.py           # 1500 lines: Too complex
```

**Split Decision Framework**:
1. **Domain Boundaries**: Different business concerns
2. **Abstraction Levels**: Core logic vs utilities
3. **Change Frequency**: Stable vs evolving code
4. **Testing Scope**: Unit vs integration concerns
5. **Dependency Patterns**: High vs low coupling

**Quality Metrics**:
- Files >700 lines require architectural review
- Files <200 lines should justify separate existence
- Average file size target: 400-500 lines
- No single file should exceed 1000 lines

#### 3.5 Card Multiplicity Architecture

**Core Principle**: Cards are instances that can proliferate and exist in multiple spatial locations simultaneously, not normalized entities.

**Card Instance Requirements**:
- Cards represent semantic content, not IDs or abstract references
- Same semantic entity can have thousands of Card instances
- Each Card instance can exist in multiple spatial zones concurrently
- Card proliferation enables pattern discovery through spatial density

**Data Transformation Patterns**:
```python
# Operational data → Card transformation
def transform_operational_event(
    event: OperationalEvent,
    semantic_extractor: SemanticExtractor
) -> Card:
    """
    Transform operational data into semantic Cards.

    Card = semantic_content (human-readable meaning)
    Tags = selection attributes (for spatial filtering)
    Content = detailed data (for expansion)
    """
    semantic_content = semantic_extractor.extract_meaning(event)
    selection_tags = semantic_extractor.extract_attributes(event)
    detailed_content = semantic_extractor.extract_details(event)

    return Card(
        content=semantic_content,  # "Fix authentication bug"
        tags=selection_tags,       # {#bug, #auth-service, #P0}
        details=detailed_content   # Full description, IDs, metadata
    )
```

**Multiplicity Implementation**:
- A user with 1000 failed logins generates 1000 Card instances
- Each Card tagged with user identifier enables aggregation
- Spatial manipulation reveals patterns through Card density
- No normalized storage - embrace semantic duplication

#### 3.6 System Tags Implementation Requirements

**Three System Tag Categories**:

1. **Operator Tags** - Generate synthetic Cards through computation
   - `COUNT` + `#user-alice` → generates Card "alice: 47 failed logins"
   - `SUM` + `#payment-failed` → generates Card "Total: $3,847 failed"
   - `RANK` + `#performance` → generates ordered performance Cards

2. **Modifier Tags** - Transform display without changing data
   - `SORT_BY_TIME` → reorders Cards chronologically within cells
   - `ALPHABETICAL` → string ordering of Cards
   - `GROUP_BY_FREQUENCY` → clusters Cards by occurrence patterns

3. **Mutation Tags** - Permanently modify Card attributes
   - `MIGRATE_SPRINT` → move Cards from sprint 1 to sprint 2
   - `BULK_RETAG` → replace tags across Card sets
   - `ARCHIVE` → add #archived tag to Cards matching criteria

**System Tag Function Pattern**:
```python
from typing import Protocol

class SystemTagFunction(Protocol):
    @abstractmethod
    def apply(
        self,
        matrix: dict[str, dict[str, frozenset[Card]]],
        target_tags: frozenset[str],
        mutation_context: Optional[MutationContext] = None
    ) -> dict[str, dict[str, frozenset[Card]]]:
        """Apply system tag operation to Card matrix."""
        ...
```

#### 3.7 Poka-yoke Safety Mechanisms

**Two-Phase Spatial Confirmation for Mutations**:

Phase 1: Preview Mode (Staging Zone)
- Mutating system tags dragged to staging zone show diff overlay
- Cards display red/green changes (tags removed/added)
- Counter shows "N Cards will be modified"
- No actual changes applied - visual preview only

Phase 2: Commit Confirmation (Confirm Zone)
- Preview Card cluster dragged to dedicated confirm zone
- Only then are mutations actually applied
- Audit trail created for all committed mutations
- Irreversible operations require double confirmation

**Physical Safety Implementation**:
```python
class MutationPreview:
    cards_affected: frozenset[Card]
    changes_preview: dict[Card, TagDiff]  # Card → {added: set, removed: set}
    mutation_count: int

    def commit(self, confirm_zone: ConfirmZone, audit: AuditContext) -> MutationResult:
        """Only executes when preview dragged to confirm zone."""
        pass

class PokayokeZones:
    staging_zone: StagingZone      # For mutation previews
    confirm_zone: ConfirmZone      # For mutation commits
    read_only_zone: ReadOnlyZone   # For safe operations
```

**Safety Design Principles**:
- Wrong actions are physically impossible, not just forbidden
- Spatial interface geometry enforces safety
- Mutating tags cannot "stick" to read-only zones
- Visual feedback (red outline) for invalid operations
- Temporal staging prevents accidental bulk mutations

#### 3.8 Function Signatures
```python
# Example format for all critical functions
def function_name(
    param1: Type,
    param2: Type,
    *,  # Force keyword-only args for clarity
    optional_param: Optional[Type] = None
) -> ReturnType:
    """
    Brief description of function purpose.

    Args:
        param1: What this parameter represents
        param2: What this parameter represents
        optional_param: When and why to use this

    Returns:
        Description of return value and structure

    Raises:
        ExceptionType: When this exception occurs
    """
```

### 4. Architectural Principles Compliance

#### 4.0.1 Card Multiplicity Compliance Requirements

**Data Transformation Standards**:
- All operational data MUST transform to semantic Cards, not abstract entities
- Card content MUST be human-readable and immediately meaningful
- IDs and reference numbers become metadata, never primary Card content
- Card proliferation is encouraged - embrace semantic duplication over normalization

**Compliance Verification**:
- [ ] Cards represent semantic meaning ("Fix auth bug") not IDs ("PROJ-1234")
- [ ] Same entity can generate multiple Card instances
- [ ] Cards can exist in multiple spatial locations simultaneously
- [ ] Spatial density reveals patterns through Card proliferation
- [ ] No normalization constraints prevent Card duplication

**System Tags Compliance**:
- [ ] Three tag categories implemented: Operator, Modifier, Mutation
- [ ] System tag functions are pure and composable
- [ ] Mutating operations use two-phase confirmation
- [ ] Poka-yoke safety prevents accidental bulk changes
- [ ] System tags work with Card multiplicity model

#### 4.0 Polymorphic Excellence Requirements

**Protocol-First Design**: Every major system component MUST be defined as a Protocol first, implementations second. This ensures:
- Maximum flexibility for future requirements
- Clean separation between interface contracts and implementation details
- Ability to swap implementations without affecting dependent systems
- Clear documentation of expected behaviors

**NO Monolithic Functions**: Functions exceeding 100 lines or handling multiple concerns MUST be decomposed into polymorphic components. Example of FORBIDDEN pattern:
```python
# FORBIDDEN: Monolithic rendering function
def render_everything(data, format_type, spatial_config, output_target):
    # 500+ lines of mixed concerns
    if format_type == 'cards':
        # card-specific logic
    elif format_type == 'charts':
        # chart-specific logic
    # ... more conditionals
```

**REQUIRED Pattern**: Polymorphic decomposition
```python
# REQUIRED: Polymorphic architecture
async def render_data(
    data: frozenset[T],
    loader: DataLoader[T],
    mapper: SpatialMapper[T, U],
    renderer: Renderer[U]
) -> Any:
    loaded = await loader.load(data)
    spatial = await mapper.map(loaded)
    return await renderer.render(spatial)
```

**Factory Pattern Mandate**: All polymorphic implementations MUST be accessible through factory functions:
```python
def create_data_loader(loader_type: str, **config) -> DataLoader[Any]:
    """Factory for all DataLoader implementations."""

def create_spatial_mapper(mapper_type: str, **config) -> SpatialMapper[Any, Any]:
    """Factory for all SpatialMapper implementations."""

def create_renderer(renderer_type: str, **config) -> Renderer[Any]:
    """Factory for all Renderer implementations."""
```

#### 4.1 Set Theory Operations
- Document all filtering operations as pure set theory
- Provide mathematical notation for complex operations
- Example: `result = (A ∩ B) ∪ (C - D)`
- **Card Multiplicity Compliance**: Set operations work on Card instances, not normalized entities
- Intersection operations preserve Card multiplicity (multiple instances pass through filters)
- Union operations aggregate Cards from different sources while maintaining instance identity

#### 4.2 Function-Based Architecture
- NO classes except for approved types (Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, Protocols, Context managers)
- **EXCEPTION**: Protocol definitions and their implementations are mandatory for polymorphic architecture
- All business logic as pure functions with explicit dependencies
- State passed explicitly, never hidden
- Polymorphic implementations MUST use classes that conform to Protocol interfaces

#### 4.3 JavaScript Restrictions
- Document any required JavaScript (should be minimal)
- Justify why HTMX cannot achieve the requirement
- Limit to approved patterns (WASM loading, DOM properties)

### 5. Performance Considerations

#### 5.1 Polymorphic Performance Requirements
- Protocol method calls MUST NOT introduce measurable overhead (target: <1μs per call)
- Implementation selection through factories MUST be O(1) lookup
- Runtime type checking limited to development/debug modes only
- All polymorphic layers MUST support horizontal scaling independently
- Caching strategies MUST work transparently across all implementations
- Scalability analysis (horizontal scaling capability)
- Bottleneck identification
- Caching strategies using approved singleton patterns
- Resource utilization estimates
