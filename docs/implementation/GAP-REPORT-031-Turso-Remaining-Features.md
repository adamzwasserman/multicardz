## Evidence of Implementation

### ❌ All Features: 0%

This is a **requirements document** with Gherkin scenarios. No implementation exists because this document **defines what needs to be built**.

---

## Recommendation

### Status: **USE AS ROADMAP**

**This is NOT a gap report candidate** - it's already a specification of gaps!

### Actions

1. **Prioritize features** from this spec
2. **Reference scenarios** when implementing
3. **Track completion** against the 62 scenarios
4. **Update Plan 030** status as features complete

---

## Summary

This document **IS the gap specification** for Turso remaining work. It's a well-structured requirements doc with BDD scenarios, not an implementation plan to audit.

**Use this document to**:
- Guide implementation of missing Turso features
- Write tests based on Gherkin scenarios
- Track progress (0/62 scenarios implemented)
- Estimate remaining work (~27 hours)
