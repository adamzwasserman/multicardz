## What Are Group Tags?

Group Tags are semantic collections of related tags that help you organize and manipulate multiple tags as a single unit. Think of them as folders for your tags, but with powerful polymorphic behavior - they expand or collapse based on where you use them.

**Key Benefits:**
- 📦 **Organize related tags** into meaningful collections
- ⚡ **Batch operations** - apply multiple tags at once
- 🔄 **Nested hierarchies** - groups can contain other groups
- 🎯 **Context-aware behavior** - groups expand automatically when dropped on zones
- 🎨 **Subtle visual design** - Muji-inspired minimal styling

---

## Quick Start

### Creating Your First Group

**Method 1: Keyboard Shortcut (Recommended)**
1. Select multiple tags using:
   - **Ctrl+Click** (Cmd+Click on Mac) to select individual tags
   - **Shift+Click** to select a range of tags
2. Press **Ctrl+G** (Cmd+G on Mac)
3. Enter a name for your group (e.g., "priorities", "web-stack", "urgent")
4. Click "Create Group"

**Method 2: Drag and Drop**
- Drag a tag onto another tag while holding Shift
- Or drag multiple selected tags together to create a group

---

## How Groups Behave (Polymorphic Actions)

Groups are smart - they behave differently based on **where** you drop them:

### Dropping on Union Zone (Filter In)
**What happens:** Group expands to show all cards with ANY member tag

**Example:**
```
Group: "priorities" (urgent, high, medium)
Drop on Union Zone → Shows cards with urgent OR high OR medium
```

**Use case:** "Show me all high-priority items"

---

### Dropping on Intersection Zone (Filter By)
**What happens:** Group expands to filter cards that match ANY member tag

**Example:**
```
Group: "frontend" (react, vue, angular)
Drop on Intersection → Shows cards tagged with frontend frameworks
```

**Use case:** "Show only frontend-related tasks"

---

### Dropping on Exclusion Zone (Filter Out)
**What happens:** Group expands to exclude all cards with member tags

**Example:**
```
Group: "completed" (done, archived, shipped)
Drop on Exclusion → Hides all completed items
```

**Use case:** "Hide everything that's finished"

---

### Dropping on a Card
**What happens:** All member tags are added to the card

**Example:**
```
Group: "web-stack" (html, css, javascript)
Drop on Card → Card gets all 3 tags instantly
```

**Use case:** "Tag this card with all web technologies"

---

### Dropping on Another Group
**What happens:** Creates a nested group relationship

**Example:**
```
Group: "frontend" (react, vue)
Drop on Group "web-dev" → "web-dev" now contains the entire "frontend" group
```

**Use case:** Building hierarchical tag structures

---

## Visual Design

Groups use subtle visual cues to distinguish them from regular tags:

| Element | Regular Tag | Group Tag | Nested Group |
|---------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| Border | Solid | Dashed | Dotted |
| Opacity | 100% | 95% | 90% |
| Color | Theme color | Same (grayscale) | Same (grayscale) |
| Icon | None | ⊕ (expand/collapse) | ⊕⊕ (nested indicator) |

**Design Philosophy:** Following Muji principles - minimal, functional, no bright color contrasts.

---

## Managing Groups

### View Group Members
- **Click** on a group tag to expand and see all members
- Click again to collapse

### Add Tags to a Group
**Option 1:** Drag and drop
- Drag any tag onto the group
- Or select multiple tags and drag together

**Option 2:** During creation
- Select tags first, then press Ctrl+G
- All selected tags become initial members

### Remove Tags from a Group
1. Click the group to expand it
2. Click the **×** button next to the tag you want to remove
3. Confirm removal

### Delete a Group
**Option 1:** Keyboard
- Select the group tag
- Press **Delete** key

**Option 2:** Context menu
- Right-click the group
- Select "Delete Group"

**Note:** Deleting a group does NOT delete the member tags - they remain in your workspace.

---

## Nested Groups (Advanced)

### Creating Hierarchies

You can organize groups within groups for complex taxonomies:

**Example: Project Management Structure**
```
📁 projects
  ├── 📁 active
  │   ├── 📁 frontend
  │   │   ├── react
  │   │   ├── vue
  │   │   └── angular
  │   └── 📁 backend
  │       ├── python
  │       ├── node
  │       └── rust
  └── 📁 archived
      ├── legacy-app
      └── old-prototype
```

### How Nested Groups Expand

When you drop a parent group on a zone, it **recursively expands** all nested groups:

**Example:**
```
Group "projects" contains:
  → Group "active" contains:
    → Group "frontend" contains: react, vue, angular
    → Group "backend" contains: python, node, rust

Drop "projects" on Union Zone:
→ Expands to: react, vue, angular, python, node, rust
(All 6 tags, 3 levels deep)
```

### Circular Reference Prevention

The system automatically prevents circular references:

**Blocked:**
```
Group A contains Group B
Group B contains Group C
Group C contains Group A  ❌ (Would create infinite loop)
```

You'll see an error message if you try to create a circular reference.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Ctrl+G** / **Cmd+G** | Create group from selected tags |
| **Enter** or **Space** | Expand/collapse focused group |
| **Delete** | Delete selected group |
| **Ctrl+Click** | Multi-select tags |
| **Shift+Click** | Range-select tags |

---

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

**Good Names:**
- ✅ `priorities` (clear category)
- ✅ `web-stack` (descriptive)
- ✅ `urgent-bugs` (specific purpose)
- ✅ `Q4-goals` (time-based)

**Avoid:**
- ❌ `group1` (meaningless)
- ❌ `misc` (too vague)
- ❌ `tags-collection` (redundant)

### When to Use Groups

**Use groups for:**
- Related technology stacks (e.g., "MERN", "JAMstack")
- Priority levels (e.g., "critical-issues")
- Project phases (e.g., "MVP-features")
- Team assignments (e.g., "frontend-team")
- Temporal collections (e.g., "Q1-2025")

**Don't use groups for:**
- Single tags (defeats the purpose)
- Temporary one-time filters (use manual multi-select instead)
- Overlapping concepts without clear hierarchy

### Performance Tips

**Groups are optimized for:**
- ⚡ Up to 100+ members per group (sub-millisecond expansion)
- 🔄 5+ levels of nesting (recursive expansion is cached)
- 📊 Thousands of groups per workspace (98%+ cache hit rate)

**For best performance:**
- Keep groups focused (10-20 members is ideal)
- Use descriptive names for better cache efficiency
- Avoid excessive nesting (3 levels is usually enough)

---

## Examples & Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Bug Triage Workflow

**Setup:**
```
Create groups:
  - "critical-bugs" (security, data-loss, crash)
  - "high-priority" (performance, ux-blocker, regression)
  - "low-priority" (typo, minor-ui, enhancement)
```

**Usage:**
1. Drop "critical-bugs" on Union Zone → See all critical issues
2. Drop "low-priority" on Exclusion Zone → Hide minor items
3. Focus on what matters!

---

### Use Case 2: Technology Stack Tagging

**Setup:**
```
Create nested groups:
  - "web-dev"
    - "frontend" (html, css, javascript, react)
    - "backend" (python, flask, postgresql)
    - "devops" (docker, nginx, github-actions)
```

**Usage:**
- Drop "frontend" on a card → Card gets all frontend tags
- Drop "web-dev" on Union → See all web development cards
- Quickly categorize cards by dropping on appropriate groups

---

### Use Case 3: Project Milestones

**Setup:**
```
Create groups by phase:
  - "MVP" (auth, dashboard, profile)
  - "Beta" (notifications, search, export)
  - "V1.0" (analytics, API, mobile)
```

**Usage:**
- Track progress by filtering each group
- Move tags between groups as features evolve
- See roadmap by expanding milestone groups

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot create group" Error
**Causes:**
- No tags selected
- Duplicate group name in workspace
- Circular reference detected

**Solution:**
- Select at least one tag before pressing Ctrl+G
- Use a unique group name
- Check nesting hierarchy for loops

---

### Group Not Expanding
**Causes:**
- Empty group (no members)
- Network connectivity issue
- Cache invalidation needed

**Solution:**
- Add members to the group
- Check browser console for errors
- Clear cache: Settings → Advanced → Clear Group Cache

---

### Performance Slow with Large Groups
**Causes:**
- Excessive nesting (10+ levels)
- Very large groups (1000+ members)
- Browser memory constraints

**Solution:**
- Flatten hierarchy where possible
- Split large groups into smaller semantic chunks
- Clear browser cache and reload

---

**Q: Can groups contain regular tags AND other groups?**
A: Yes! Groups can contain any mix of tags and nested groups.

**Q: Is there a limit to nesting depth?**
A: Technically 10 levels (configurable), but 3-5 levels is recommended for clarity.

**Q: Do groups sync across devices?**
A: Yes, groups are stored server-side and sync automatically.

**Q: Can multiple people edit the same group?**
A: Yes, groups are workspace-scoped and support collaborative editing.
