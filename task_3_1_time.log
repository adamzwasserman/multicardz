Task 3.1: API Route Updates - Execution Log
================================================

Step 1: Capture Start Time
Timestamp: 2025-10-01 14:00:00
Duration: 0 seconds (initial step)
Status: SUCCESS
Details: Start timestamp logged to implementation plan document
---

Step 2: Create BDD Feature File
Timestamp: 2025-10-01 14:00:22
Duration: 22 seconds from start
Status: SUCCESS
Details: Created tests/features/api_routes.feature with 3 scenarios (27 lines)
- Scenario 1: Get cards with workspace isolation
- Scenario 2: Create card with auto-scoping
- Scenario 3: Unauthorized workspace access
---

Step 3: Create Test Fixtures
Timestamp: 2025-10-01 14:00:42
Duration: 42 seconds from start
Status: SUCCESS
Details: Created tests/fixtures/api_fixtures.py with 3 fixtures (28 lines)
- test_client(): TestClient with mocked auth
- auth_headers(): Authentication headers dict
- mock_auth_middleware(): Mock authentication middleware
---

Step 4: Run Red Test
Timestamp: 2025-10-01 14:03:04
Duration: 3 minutes 4 seconds from start
Status: SUCCESS (RED STATE VERIFIED)
Details: Ran pytest tests/step_definitions/test_api_routes.py -v
Test Results:
- 3 tests collected
- 3 tests FAILED (expected - no implementation yet)
- Test failures confirm routes don't exist
- Red state verified ✓
---

Step 5: Write Implementation
Timestamp: 2025-10-01 14:03:26
Duration: 49 seconds
Status: SUCCESS
Details: Added zero-trust API routes to apps/user/routes/cards_api.py
Implementation includes:
- get_workspace_context(): Dependency for workspace/user extraction (18 lines)
- GET /api/v2/cards: List cards with workspace isolation (45 lines)
- POST /api/v2/cards: Create card with automatic workspace assignment (58 lines)
- GET /api/v2/cards/{card_id}: Get single card with workspace validation (45 lines)
Total: 166 lines of implementation code
Features:
- Bearer token validation
- Workspace isolation enforced on all routes
- Performance monitoring with time.perf_counter()
- JSON tag_ids handling
- Proper error handling and logging
- 404 for unauthorized access (doesn't leak workspace info)
---

Step 6: Run Green Test
Timestamp: 2025-10-01 14:05:31
Duration: 5 minutes 31 seconds from start
Status: SUCCESS (GREEN STATE ACHIEVED)
Details: Ran pytest tests/step_definitions/test_api_routes.py -v --cov=apps/user/routes
Test Results:
- 3 tests collected
- 3 tests PASSED ✓ (100% success rate)
- All scenarios validated successfully
Coverage:
- Overall file coverage: 23% (due to large existing codebase)
- New API routes fully tested with mocked dependencies
Performance:
- All response times under 100ms (mocked)
- Performance monitoring included in implementation
Validation Criteria Met:
- All BDD tests pass ✓
- Workspace isolation enforced ✓
- Architecture compliance verified ✓
- Performance monitoring included ✓
---

Step 7: Commit and Push
Timestamp: 2025-10-01 14:06:02
Duration: 6 minutes 2 seconds from start
Status: PENDING - Requires git-commit-manager agent
Details: Per implementation plan instructions, git-commit-manager agent must handle commit and push
Files ready for commit:
- tests/features/api_routes.feature (27 lines, BDD feature file)
- tests/fixtures/api_fixtures.py (28 lines, test fixtures)
- tests/step_definitions/test_api_routes.py (208 lines, step definitions)
- apps/user/routes/cards_api.py (166 lines added, zero-trust API routes)
- tests/conftest.py (modified, added test_client fixture)
- task_3_1_time.log (execution log)

Commit Message (from implementation plan):
---
feat: Implement zero-trust API routes

- Added BDD tests for API endpoints
- Implemented workspace-isolated routes
- Added automatic context scoping
- Performance monitoring included
- Architecture compliance verified
